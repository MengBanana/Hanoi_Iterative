# Hanoi_iterative

This HanoiStack class implement the Tower of Hanoi in an iterative way

The rules:
Only one disk can be moved at a time
Each one moves the top disk from one stack on top to another stack
No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk 

For an even number of disks:
make the legal move between pegs A and B (in either direction)
make the legal move between pegs A and C (in either direction)
make the legal move between pegs B and C (in either direction),
repeat until complete.

For an odd number of disks:
make the legal move between pegs A and C (in either direction)
make the legal move between pegs A and B (in either direction)
make the legal move between pegs B and C (in either direction),
